# Quality-Prediction

This project explores different machine learning models to predict the quality of wine based on physicochemical properties. The dataset includes features like acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol content, and more.

 Models Used
Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Evaluation
Each model was trained and evaluated using metrics such as:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

RÂ² Score

 Findings
Random Forest performed the best overall in terms of prediction accuracy.

Linear Regression provided a strong baseline.

KNN was sensitive to the choice of k and performed moderately well.
