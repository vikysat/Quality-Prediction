# Quality-Prediction

This project explores different machine learning models to predict the quality of wine based on physicochemical properties. The dataset includes features like acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol content, and more.

 Models Used:
 
 Linear Regression
 Random Forest Regressor
 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)


 Findings:

 Random Forest performed the best overall in terms of prediction accuracy.
 Linear Regression provided a strong baseline.
 KNN was sensitive to the choice of k and performed moderately well.
